____

The May 2024 release provides the first public beta of the OKIT - Open Cloud Designer

This Beta release shows the new desktop functionality that will be available in the next iteration of OKIT providing Native Installers rather than the current Web Based solution. In addtion to a native installation the designer provides a true Drag-&-Drop interface allowing the user to define the layout of there design without any of the previous restrictions.

The concept of container based layouts has been remove and as such Compartment are nolonger represented on the canvas but are created as tabs across the top of the design with functionality that will allow the user to hide/show resources associated with the compartment. We have also added the concept of multiple Page/Views of the designs resources by placing page tabs at the bottom of the design. Here the user can create addition pages to show sub-sets of the designs resources, which can be selected from the "model" palette.

At present the Open Cloud Designer only supports a subset of the original OKIT (Web) resources but this covers the core resource and more will be added soon.
